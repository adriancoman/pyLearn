# Py Learn

Just messing around to see what all the hype is about with ML/AI and ðŸ¤— Huggingface while learning a little python.

## text2Voice
Based on an uploaded image, it will generate a short description. Using that description, it will create a short story that in the end will be converted to an audio recording.
To run it use:
```
streamlit run image2voice.py
```
Or uncomment the lines at the end, provide the image and it's path and run it as a normal python script:
```
python image2voice.py
```

## pdfAnswers
Takes a local PDF file, converts it to text, and then it can answer questions based on the extracted text. (still WIP)
```
python pdfAnswers.py
```
